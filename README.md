# CIRCLE FALL
### For now no cool name, sorry I'm a programmer, not a designer or something like that

Circle Fall is an application that uses Godot's built in Rigid body physics to make a ball fall down.

This is for these marble running videos that pop up on YouTube quite a lot, feel free to make a level with godot (level editor coming soon or never idk)

Circle Fall is not responsible for crashing your PC, because you make the levels yourself

I'm looking into releasing this for android too for shorts or tiktok streams, stay tuned

For now this is a very early release of this program so bugs pop up here and there.

Circle Fall has arrow controls if the ball gets stuck somewhere

Requirements:
        CPU (Optional)
        GPU (Optional)
